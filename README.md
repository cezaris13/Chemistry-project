# Chemistry project for the gymnasium 10th grade

## The concept
When app is opened the list of chemistry recipes are chown.
Then the user can choose one, and calculate how many portions he can make with the ingrediens he has.

The other option what he can do is to calculate how many ingredients he needs based on the portions he wants to make.

## 2024 update

Refactored the code to use kotlin and jetpack compose to learn it and moved the hardcoded recipe data to firebase.
